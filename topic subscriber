subcriber code to be saved in src file in ur pavakage :

#! /usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Int32

def callback(msg):                                  #define a function called 'callback' that recives a parameter named 'msg'
	
	print msg.data                                    #print value 'data' inside the msg parameter 


rospy.init_node('topic_subscriber')                 #initiate a node called topic_subscriber

sub = rospy.Subscriber('/control',Int32 , callback) #create a subscriber object that will listen to /control
                                                    #topic and will  cal call callback function each time it reads 
						   #something from topic 
rospy.spin()                                        #create a loop that will keep the program in execution


now save it  and try run subcriber using :
rosrun <pacakage name> <subscriber code file name>

in my case it was like :
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py

nothing appears because topic is not pubished yet for topic_subscriber node

now try publishing :
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rostopic pub /control std_msgs/Int32 'data: 5'
publishing and latching message. Press ctrl-C to terminate

then check in subscriber terminal it would appear like:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py
5

data 5 has been published from /topic_publisher node to /topic_subscriiber node using topic /control

exercise :
publish the control.py code now:

ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials control.py

check the node present by:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosnode list
/rosout
/rostopic_8159_1560191513375
/topic_publisher
/topic_subscriber
 
both publisher node and subscriber node would appear 

in subscriber terminal it would be subscribed the published data as:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py
5
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
^Cros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ 

after press ctr+c in publisher terminal  it would stop publishing so the subscriber doesnot get any data.

execise :
>1. add to the current pakage a python file that creates a publisher that indicates the age of the robot
>2.for that you need to a new custom msg file Age.msg 

step 1: create a custom msg file:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg$ gedit age.msg

in custom msg age.msg file add :
float32 years
float32 months 
float32 days

then create a publisher file:
#! /usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from beginner_tutorials.msg import Age

rospy.init_node('robo_age_publisher')
pub = rospy.Publisher('/age/publisher',Age,queue_size=1)

rate =rospy.Rate(2)
age=Age()
age.years= 7
age.months= 8
age.days= 6

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
	pub.publish(age)
	
	rate.sleep()
	
then create asubscriber file:
#! /usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from beginner_tutorials.msg import Age

def callback(msg):
	print ("years :"+ str(msg.years)+"months :" + str (msg.months)+"days :" + str(msg.days))

rospy.init_node('robo_age_subscriber')
sub = rospy.Subscriber('/age/publisher',Age,callback)
rospy.spin()

then output of these would be:
in my case:
terminal 1:
Cros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials agepub.py

terminal 2:
Cros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials agesub.py
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0

years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0
years :7.0months :8.0days :6.0

the communicating nodes were :
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosnode list
""/robo_age_publisher    (this were the 
/robo_age_subscriber""      nodes )
/rosout
/rostopic_8159_1560191513375
/topic_publisher
/topic_subscriber

and the topic was:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rostopic list
''''/age/publisher''' (this was the topic)
/control
/rosout
/rosout_agg
