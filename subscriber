subcriber code to be saved in src file in ur pavakage :

#! /usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Int32

def callback(msg):                                  #define a function called 'callback' that recives a parameter named 'msg'
	
	print msg.data                                    #print value 'data' inside the msg parameter 


rospy.init_node('topic_subscriber')                 #initiate a node called topic_subscriber

sub = rospy.Subscriber('/control',Int32 , callback) #create a subscriber object that will listen to /control
                                                    #topic and will  cal call callback function each time it reads 
						   #something from topic 
rospy.spin()                                        #create a loop that will keep the program in execution


now save it  and try run subcriber using :
rosrun <pacakage name> <subscriber code file name>

in my case it was like :
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py

nothing appears because topic is not pubished yet for topic_subscriber node

now try publishing :
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rostopic pub /control std_msgs/Int32 'data: 5'
publishing and latching message. Press ctrl-C to terminate

then check in subscriber terminal it would appear like:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py
5

data 5 has been published from /topic_publisher node to /topic_subscriiber node using topic /control

exercise :
publish the control.py code now:

ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials control.py

check the node present by:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosnode list
/rosout
/rostopic_8159_1560191513375
/topic_publisher
/topic_subscriber
 
both publisher node and subscriber node would appear 

in subscriber terminal it would be subscribed the published data as:
ros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials controlsub.py
5
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
^Cros@ros:~/catkin_ws$ 

after press ctr+c in publisher terminal  it would stop publishing so the subscriber doesnot get any data.
